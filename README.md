# Automation Scripts

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts written by me and designed to automate various daily manual processes. The aim is to streamline and simplify tasks such as file sorting and desktop cleaning, enhancing productivity and organization and more.

## Automation Scripts

1. **File Sorter (`file_sorter.py`)**: 
   - **Purpose**: Automatically sorts files from a specific source folder into categorized destination folders based on file types.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Configurable source and destination paths.
     - Supports various file types including images and documents.
     - Skips files that already exist in the destination to avoid duplicates.

2. **Desktop Cleaner (`desktop_cleaner.py`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Cleans up the desktop by moving files older than two days to a designated folder.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Checks the last modified time of each file.
     - Moves files older than a specified threshold to declutter the desktop.

## Future Enhancements
This is an ongoing project, and more automation scripts will be added in the future to address other manual tasks. Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

## Usage
To use these scripts:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Modify the source and destination paths in the scripts to suit your needs.
3. Run the scripts using Python.

## Contributing
